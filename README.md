# E-commerce-Recommender
E-commerce Recommendation System using Python

This is an academic project of a Personalized E-commerce Recommendation System. 
The data analysis pipeline involved the below steps:
1. Data Exploration  
2. Data Pre-processing  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Machine learning models testing,finetuning and evaluation–  
- User and Model-based Collaborative Filtering  
- SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and SVD ++  
- Alternating Least Squares (ALS)  
- KNN Clustering     

Libraries used:
Pandas, Skikit-learn, PySpark, Seaborn, Surprise    

The Dataset is from a public dataset from OList, a Brazilian Ecommerce store:
